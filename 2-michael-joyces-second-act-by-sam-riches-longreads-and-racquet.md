When i arrived at the link of this article, i did not know about mr.michael joyce. i am very fond of tennis, but do not follow it ardently. since the article said that it is about his second act, so i reckoned he might be just about my age, so that means, when he would have been playing, i was young and during my younger days, i used to follow tennis more regularly. those were the days with less distraction after all.

i tried hard to remember his name, but could not, which means that he did not win block-bluster grand-slams. but he had been an important player enough for someone to write about his second innings as a coach, professionally and a husband and father, personally.

that intrigued me to read this article.

there are always so much to learn from the lives of sports persons who play individual sports, there is nothing tougher out there in the world than that.

there are some good lessons to carry away from the article, which often come as obvious, after reading such descriptions.

but overall, something felt just missing to me, after finishing reading this articleâ€¦
